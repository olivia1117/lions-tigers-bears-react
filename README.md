# “Lions and Tigers and Bears, Oh My!” Project

### Overview 
This is a projects based on a Wizard of Oz movie scene and was originally copied from Brad Schiff’s tutorial on YouTube for creating a JavaScript web application that uses a public API about dogs to teach how different topics like fetch, promises, and async awaits work. Credits are listed further below. This version is slightly different because it is using React instead. 

### How to Run This Application
If you want to run this project locally, you can clone this repository to your computer. Then open the files in an editor like VSCode. From there you can open a new terminal and then type the command: npm install

This will install the necessary modules listed in package.json. If you don’t want this modules to appear as changes or when you commit new changes to the repository, you can add node_modules/ or wherever you stored them into a .gitignore file.

Then, to start the web application on a local development server, run the command: npm start This will compile the React app and then open it in a default browser usually at http://localhost:3000 If there are issues with this, you may have set that specific port for something else on your machine so you may need to research how to change that so it can run on your browser locally and view any changes before committing them to GitHub.

If you do get to a point where you would like to commit any changes, then you can use a terminal or the separate source control center in VSCode to view the changed files and then write a commit message before clicking on the dropdown menu to commit and push the changes.

If you have this hosted on Azure through GitHub, then you can check its build progress through GitHub actions and then once it’s built successfully, then you can view the Azure site through the link for the static site.
